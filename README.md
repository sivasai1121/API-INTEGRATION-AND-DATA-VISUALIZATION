** COVID-19 Data Visualization using Python and Real-Time API

** Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Python-based analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data across multiple countries using real-time information fetched from the `disease.sh` API. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how data science techniques and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn can be effectively used to understand trends and patterns in pandemic data. This analysis focuses on 10 major countries — the USA, India, Brazil, Russia, France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Japan, and Canada — and presents insights in the form of comparative bar charts and pie charts. The entire implementation is done in a Jupyter/Google Colab notebook and is aimed at data science enthusiasts, learners, and professionals who want a real-world example of data visualization applied to global health data.

** Motivation and Importance

COVID-19 had a massive impact globally, and analyzing its data is essential for public health research, awareness, and decision-making. However, understanding raw data can be difficult without proper tools and visual representation. This project was created to bridge that gap by turning real-time pandemic data into understandable, visually rich insights. This project also serves as a learning resource for anyone looking to explore real-world APIs, clean and analyze data using Pandas, and present insights using visualizations in Python.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for scripting.
- **Pandas**: Used for data storage, manipulation, and processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating detailed bar and pie charts.
- **Seaborn**: For aesthetically pleasing statistical plots.
- **Requests**: To fetch real-time COVID-19 data from the `disease.sh` API.
- **Google Colab**: Used as the development and execution environment for writing and running Python code online.

## Features and Functionalities

1. **Real-Time Data Retrieval**:  
   The project connects to the `disease.sh` API to retrieve up-to-date statistics on COVID-19 for selected countries.

2. **Bar Chart of Total COVID-19 Cases by Country**:  
   This visualization shows the cumulative total number of confirmed cases across the chosen countries, offering a visual comparison of the severity of spread.

3. **Bar Chart of Total Deaths by Country**:  
   This helps in understanding the fatal impact of COVID-19 in each country.

4. **Pie Chart of Active vs Recovered Cases**:  
   A pie chart is generated for the country with the highest number of confirmed cases, breaking down the proportion of currently active cases vs. recovered ones. This gives a clear snapshot of the recovery rate and ongoing severity.

5. **Error Handling**:  
   The script includes exception handling to manage API call failures or data retrieval issues.

6. **DataFrame Construction and Export (optional)**:  
   The fetched data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis or export.
